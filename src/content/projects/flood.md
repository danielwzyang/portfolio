My friend started a club centered around volunteering to help with the flooding issue in NYC. He needed a website to provide info about the club, so he asked me for help.
<br><br>
I built the website using NextJS and TailwindCSS, and this was my first time using shadcn/ui. I used some components from shadcn like the Sheet for the Navbar and the Card for the team members. I also used the Calendar component, and I had to edit it to allow me to highlight event days. To fetch the events, I created a public Google Calendar and used the Google API. I used Day.js to handle some timezone issues since we needed the events in NYC time.
