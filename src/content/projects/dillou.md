For my intro to CS class, our teacher gave us a final project to do whatever we wanted. I decided to make a game based off of Pou, a mobile pet simulation game. Instead of Pou, the pet was our teacher. My teacher ended up bringing his six year old son to work one day, and his son played my game.

I built the game using Godot since I had some prior experience using it. We had two weeks to do it, which was enough time for me to implement food, crumb picking, currency, and a shop. For the food, I added a simple drag and drop as well as a "snap back" feature. After eating food, crumbs spawn in the beard which can be picked to get coins. The coins are then used to buy more food through the shop.
