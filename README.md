# My Portfolio
I built this website using Astro, TailwindCSS, and anime.js. I decided to use Astro because I noticed that NextJS was pretty bloated and I wanted something lightweight for my content-based portfolio. Astro seemed like a perfect fit given that it's incredibly lightweight and optimized for performance. Their content collections is also another great feature that I wanted to take advantage of, and I use them to store all the information on my projects. I used TailwindCSS to style the website because I'm comfortable with it, and I wanted to use anime.js just for fun.
